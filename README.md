This code implements a single-neuron perceptron with a sigmoid activation for linearly separable two-class classification in 2D. The user selects training points for two classes using mouse clicks. Inputs are augmented with a bias, and target labels are assigned. The perceptron updates its weights using the delta rule adapted for the sigmoid function. During training, the separating line is plotted dynamically, and the error over iterations is tracked and displayed. Training stops when the error falls below a defined threshold.
